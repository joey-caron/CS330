# CS330
Repository for the work in my CS 330 Comp Graphic and Visualization course

1. How do I approach designing software?
 - My approach to designing software is to first focus on functionality. It doesn't matter how good something looks if it doesn't do the things it is supposed to. I attempt to keep things as modular as possible, putting as much into separate classes as I can, do that the main file is mostly just calling class methods and that's it. 

2. How do I approach developing programs?
 - My approach to developing programs is to first build a program skeleton, the basic framework that will be the same no matter what the program entails. At that point, I review the requirements and if they aren't already in a list, I put them in one. I then go step by step down the list, building classes and methods as needed to meet each requirement along the way.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 - My goal in general is to acheive a career as a programmer, so obviously computer science will help me reach that goal. I'm not sure if in the future I will be in a field that specifically uses computer graphics and visualization to create 3D scenes or not, but regardless I feel the things I learned in this course are valuable and can easily be applied to my future career no matter where life takes me.
